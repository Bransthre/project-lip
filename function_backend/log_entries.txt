A quick status update
I am just listening to Brahm's Symphony while starting my work today. Today feels a bit better because I finished a lot of work prior to today, which provides me quite a gap to make myself less guilty about being lazy with. Still, since the work I do today is quite important to the progress of the project, I can't loose up too much!
Currently working on the graph-represented structuring of EI interventions.

I am currently working to set LinkedIn up.
It's a bit nervewrecking, but I'll see what I can do. I'm assuming that most of the update on this website comes after I finished my resume.

It's morning and I woke up earlier than usual. My family just left to live at another place, so I should be readying for another two weeks of independent life. I have to keep reminding myself that even though I am currently alone, I am not independent.

I am currently working on Leetcode as a warmup for the day and a less time-consuming task for before driving school. I think I will also slowly get adjusted to alone life.

Just got back from driving school. Because I didn't ate much today, driving becomes very much more exhausting and nervous.

Currently working at the cafe, and re-implementing some of the previous ML utilities in Project Lip. Will be able to finish the training function soon, and then it's the predict!

A bit tired and hungry from morning's work, but will keep on for a bit.

Was leetcoding, stayed at cafe for too long. But just one question left, I'll finish it before I go home and call it a day for a bit.
