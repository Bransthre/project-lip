A quick status update
I am just listening to Brahm's Symphony while starting my work today. Today feels a bit better because I finished a lot of work prior to today, which provides me quite a gap to make myself less guilty about being lazy with. Still, since the work I do today is quite important to the progress of the project, I can't loose up too much!
Currently working on the graph-represented structuring of EI interventions.

I am currently working to set LinkedIn up.
It's a bit nervewrecking, but I'll see what I can do. I'm assuming that most of the update on this website comes after I finished my resume.

It's morning and I woke up earlier than usual. My family just left to live at another place, so I should be readying for another two weeks of independent life. I have to keep reminding myself that even though I am currently alone, I am not independent.

I am currently working on Leetcode as a warmup for the day and a less time-consuming task for before driving school. I think I will also slowly get adjusted to alone life.

Just got back from driving school. Because I didn't ate much today, driving becomes very much more exhausting and nervous.

Currently working at the cafe, and re-implementing some of the previous ML utilities in Project Lip. Will be able to finish the training function soon, and then it's the predict!

A bit tired and hungry from morning's work, but will keep on for a bit.

Was leetcoding, stayed at cafe for too long. But just one question left, I'll finish it before I go home and call it a day for a bit.

At the cafe now.
Model tuning isn't going well recently, currently trying to solve leetcode first before I get to retuning the model.

Studying at the cafe now, leetcoding as usual. Ready to fix interface bugs and retune models later, but I don't know how well this could go..

Moved in and helped move in for three days in a row, and woke up really early this morning. I'm excited to see my roommate today!

Monday of the week that school is about to start! Today I will process some intern applications as well as get a basic structure for the Linkedin referral system. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to all the other work, since recruitment isn't much of an exciting aspect for career development...
