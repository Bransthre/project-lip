A quick status update
I am just listening to Brahm's Symphony while starting my work today. Today feels a bit better because I finished a lot of work prior to today, which provides me quite a gap to make myself less guilty about being lazy with. Still, since the work I do today is quite important to the progress of the project, I can't loose up too much!
Currently working on the graph-represented structuring of EI interventions.

I am currently working to set LinkedIn up.
It's a bit nervewrecking, but I'll see what I can do. I'm assuming that most of the update on this website comes after I finished my resume.

It's morning and I woke up earlier than usual. My family just left to live at another place, so I should be readying for another two weeks of independent life. I have to keep reminding myself that even though I am currently alone, I am not independent.

I am currently working on Leetcode as a warmup for the day and a less time-consuming task for before driving school. I think I will also slowly get adjusted to alone life.

Just got back from driving school. Because I didn't ate much today, driving becomes very much more exhausting and nervous.

Currently working at the cafe, and re-implementing some of the previous ML utilities in Project Lip. Will be able to finish the training function soon, and then it's the predict!

Was leetcoding, stayed at cafe for too long. But just one question left, I'll finish it before I go home and call it a day for a bit.

At the cafe now.
Model tuning isn't going well recently, currently trying to solve leetcode first before I get to retuning the model.

Studying at the cafe now, leetcoding as usual. Ready to fix interface bugs and retune models later, but I don't know how well this could go..

Monday of the week that school is about to start! Today I will process some intern applications as well as get a basic structure for the Linkedin referral system. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to all the other work, since recruitment isn't much of an exciting aspect for career development...

Doing a lot of work today, but I believe I'll get it through! I just need to prepare for interviews and do a bit more applications and informational interviews!

Today I was able to reboot this project and look forward to working with it during the next semester. I was sad that I didn't have time to work with this project and develop to its full potential like how it is worthy of. I am excited to see what's in store for Lip.
