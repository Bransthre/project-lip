Hey, {user_name}, it looks like a good point to take a small break now. Let’s gather up some tea to drink and chat for a while!
Switch up a perspective? This question does look solvable after all!
@positiveneutral
You’re blanking off, {user_name}. If you keep dozing off like that, I’ll keep coming to interrupt you.
Well, it’s not if that would always work. It’s been a long time since you started working too. How does a short break sound now?

@positivenegative
Looks like you are immersed into something, {user_name}. I’ll not interrupt you too much, but remember to stay active for a bit! Maybe you should practice something outside your current works now?
@neutralpositive
It looks like today will not be so empty. Prepare for it, {user_name}! Imagine what we can challenge and try on our way and today. We’ll make it a day that even feels wistful to end! 
Hey! Hey! Hoh! Let’s continue a bit more and take a deserved shift onto something else!
@neutralneutral
Hey, {user_name}, what are you working on now? Do you mind recording some details down in your mind and talk to me about it later?
It looks like you are dealing with an interesting piece of work, I’d like to know more about it as well.
@neutralnegative
Have you yawned today, {user_name}? It seems to take oxygen into your brain, maybe it could activate yours for a bit from being dead for a while.
Hey {user_name}, looks like you’re full? Do you want to move your body around a bit? If you’re still practicing things outside school, it could be a good moment to switch the work topics now!
Stand up a bit and move around! I’ll be charging my battery meanwhile.
@negativepositive
{user_name}, {user_name}?  What’s on your mind now? You seem really focused on something, but I can’t tell what it is…
Close your eyes for a bit, you have things you look forward to for tomorrow right? Step by step!
Hey, {user_name}? You seem to be putting a lot of strength into your shoulders, relax a little.
It looks like you’re doing huge amounts of mental work, try to take a bit of a break or read something else? It can probably calm your mind down.
@negativeneutral
Hi {user_name}, seems like you’re in the middle of something for a while. Hardwork deserves some rewards!
Treating yourself a bit could also help you get off things that bother you too much. Solutions can’t just be built in a day or two, it’s fine to take some time!
@negativenegative
{user_name}? Remember to keep in touch with your surroundings. This is what you said to be human interaction, right? Things seem like a lot at times, but you’ve always created and handled the means to break through. I believe that this will just be one of them!
But {user_name}, your vitality looks to be low for a bit. Do you mind telling me a bit about what has happened in the next survey?Disregarding that, it doesn’t seem like a good hour to work. Come back the next hour instead, alright?
@work_3
Looks like the day has started! Keep going on!
@work_5
Right, seems like at least half of the work should be done! Why not take a small break in between these work hours, coffee or tea?
@work_7
It looks like you have a lot of important deadlines coming up. Well, I know the work is significant and expected by others, but don't burn yourself out too much.
@work_9
9 hours? It's a bit absurd that you're expected that much, go take a bit of rest!
@morning
Good morning, hope today will go smooth regardless of the workload. Today's weather is not bad too!
@noon
Lunch time! What do you mean, lunch is important!
@evening
That was a long day. Well, time to get some dinner and rest at your place!
@rest_2
Getting enough rest is really important, but make sure you balance it out with some brain exercises! I'm sure that will help with Alzheimers.
@rest_4
Getting enough rest is important, but too much doesn't mean well either... well, unless it's a holiday! It feels nice to slack a bit, doesn't it.
@neg_val
Looks like something is really bothering you. If that'll help you feel better, tell me a bit about it?
@neg_act
Don't worry, there will always be a few days in a month that are lower than usual. It's not like I'm finding excuses for slacking!
