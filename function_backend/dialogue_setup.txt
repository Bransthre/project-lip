"... I see, I am finally being initialized. Took you some great work!"
"Ehem, nothing... \nLet me try to launch my systems up in the background. \nLike this...... like that......"

"First of all, what is your name?"
"Ah, I see. So you are {user_name}."
"And then, since I will be helping you on your computer,\nI also want to know how often do you wish me to check in on you."
"Enter the check up interval you'd like as a number, in units of minutes."
